# Git tricks 1:  Ignoring an entire folder... without touching project .gitignore
By putting a .gitignore file with a single asterisk in it in a subdirectory of a project, all files under that subdirectory will be ignored, as well as the subdirectory itself, without any visible impact on the rest of your project.

I first discovered this trick when working with `mypy`, microsoft's static typing for python. Like `__pycache__`, mypy creates a cache in the current directory to store type hints for itself.

```bash
$ tree
.
├── .gitignore # your project .gitignore
├── .mypy_cache # Hide this somehow
│   └── main.data.json
└── main.py
```

These are autogenerated and shouldn't live in your code; but at the same time mypy didn't want to edit your project's `.gitignore`.

One way of doing this would be to add a line `.mypy_cache` to the `.gitignore` in the project root, but that would require a modification to the project. A .gitignore might be structured in a certain way, or parsed or autogenerated by the project itself, so it would be nice not to have to touch the project's root .gitignore at all.

So instead, mypy creates a `.gitignore` file inside the `.mypy_cache` folder, with a single asterisk:
```bash
$ tree
.
├── .gitignore
├── .mypy_cache
│   ├── .gitignore # inside .gitignore
│   └── main.data.json
└── main.py

$ cat .mypy_cache/.gitignore
*

$ git ls-files
main.py
.gitignore
# nothing in .mypy_cache, not even the directory itself 
```
This asterisk means 'ignore everything', but since `.gitignores` are scoped to the subdirectory, only everything in the `.mypy_cache` is ignored. Git also has a quirk where it doesn't cache empty directories, so then the entire `.mypy_cache` leaves absolutely no footprint on your project. Sweet!

 You might use this trick with a local-to-your-computer `my-scripts` folder that is only relevant to the current project, but you might not want to commit to source control; or, in cpp, a `coredumps` folder; or even `build_output_logs`.
